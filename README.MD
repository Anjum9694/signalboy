Signal Boy
==========

Signal Boy is a personal JavaFX project to help me understand digital signal processing. But it can be used as a "for-fun" tool to play with radio signals, creating and receiving modulations.

Releases
-------
There's currently no releases as the code is a little messy, buggy and it is very early in life. :-P

Dependencies
-------
JTransforms for FFT and stuff - https://github.com/wendykierp/JTransforms
